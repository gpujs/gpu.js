Thanks for taking the time to contribute to gpu.js. Follow these guidelines to make the process smoother:

1. One feature per pull request. Each PR should have one focus, and all the code changes should be supporting that one feature or bug fix. Using a [separate branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for each feature should help you manage developing multiple features at once.

2. Follow the style of the file when it comes to syntax like curly braces and indents.

3. Add a test for the feature or fix, if possible. See the `test` directory for existing tests and README describing how to run these tests.
